### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on on a transformer model from scratch to paraphrase sentences, then I'll compare the outcomes to a fine tuned BERT model using Google Colab!
- I'm also working on getting a pix2pix model working since I think it'd be fun to have cool ideas to conditionally generate on an image
