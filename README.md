### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m *currently* working on on a transformer model from scratch to paraphrase sentences, and then I'll compare the outcomes to a fine-tuned BERT model using Google Colab!
- I'm also working on getting a pix2pix model working since I think it'd be fun to have cool ideas to conditionally generate on an image

ðŸ’¬ About my pinned repos:
- **Data professional analysis** was done collaboratively to analyze StackOverflow data to see how data professional salaries change over time.
- **UFC Visualization** is a Bokeh web app that allows a user to pick parameters (fighter, KOs, wins, losses) and create their own story for a visualization.
- **Paper replications** are my proudest repository since I like machine learning, it's like magic to me. I pick some papers that sound cool to me, then I recreate the specified architectures and train on their data sets or another one!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™d like to learn more about general programming so in the future I'll hopefully find the time to learn another language like C++ for more projects besides data ones in the future!
